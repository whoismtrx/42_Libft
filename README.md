# Libft
## Overview
This project remakes some usual C language functions and adds a few new ones that will help students. The main goal is to make a set of functions that can be used again in later work, so students don't have to write them from scratch each time. This set of functions will be needed for most projects at 42. the project is a great opportunity to improve your skills in C programming and to learn about the structure of a library.

## Key Features
The project contains 2 parts: `Mandatory` and `Bonus`
- `Mandatory` part contains functions from `Libc` and `Additional` ones that are useful for everyday programming.
- `Bonus` part contains functions that are useful for linked list manipulation.
you need also to create a `Makefile` that compiles the library and a `libft.h` file which outputs an archive called `libft.a`.

## Getting Started
to get started with using `libft`, clone the repository and compile the library using the provided Makefile.
git clone https://github.com/whoismtrx/42_Libft.git libft
cd libft
make
